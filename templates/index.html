            <h3>Glyrics (WIP)</h3>
            
            <p>
                Glyrics was made to remove the need to search for lyrics,
                currently it only supports Spotify. The way it works: 
                you log your spotify account (external url to https://accounts.spotify.com)
                start playing any song, and it will automatically fetch the lyrics 
                and the URL to the lyrics on Genius.com

            </p>
            <p>To start using it, click the button bellow and connect your Spotify Account.</p>
            <a href="{{ url_for('lyrics') }}"><button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Start</button></a>
            <br><br>
            <p>Disclaimer: this app does not have access to your Spotify credentials.</p>
